# The Grid
The Grid is a decentralized, slack based, chatroom application. It is
developed as a way to have robust features which carry over from applications
like Guilds, or Discord. And it has the privacy features of applications such
as Signal.

Self hosted, and E2E encrypted, The Grid provides security features that have
been demanded by users for years! And we can finally say, we will provide! One
other cool feature of The Grid is that it's meant to integrate with a later VR
and realworld mashup project called Nexus.
